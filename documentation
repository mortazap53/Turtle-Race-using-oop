# 🐢 Turtle Race Game — Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

The project is modular and split across multiple files, each with a specific responsibility:

* Game orchestration
* Turtle creation
* Race logic
* Result evaluation

This documentation explains **how the system works**, **how to reuse it**, and **how you can change it carefully** without breaking it.

## 2. File Structure

```
project
│
├── main.py            # Entry point (user inputs + game start)
├── game.py            # Main game controller
├── turtle_racer.py    # Turtle creation logic
├── race.py            # Race engine
├── bet_result.py      # Bet evaluation & result output
```

## 3. High-Level Flow (IMPORTANT)

Understanding this flow is mandatory before modifying anything.

1. `main.py`

   * Asks how many players
   * Asks for turtle colors
   * Asks for turtle positions
   * Creates a `TurtleGame` object
   * Starts the game

2. `Game.make_racers()`

   * Creates turtle racers
   * Collects player names and bets

3. `Game.start_game()`

   * Runs the race

4. `Game.get_result()`

   * Evaluates results

5. `Run`

   * Moves turtles randomly
   * Tracks their x‑coordinates
   * Stops when race ends

6. `GetResult`

   * Sorts turtles by distance
   * Matches bets to results
   * Prints winners

---

## 4. main.py (Entry Point)

### Purpose

Acts as the **launcher**. Nothing more.

### What You Can Change Safely

* Turtle colors list
* Turtle starting positions
* Number of players range (2–6)

### Critical Rules

* `turtle_color` and `turtle_position` **must match or exceed** number of players
* Do NOT bring game logic into `main.py`

### Example Customization

```python
turtle_color = ["purple", "cyan", "pink"]
turtle_position = [0, -50, 50]
```

---

## 5. game.py — `TurtleGame` (Core Controller)

### Purpose

This is the **brain of the project**. It coordinates everything.

### Constructor

```python
TurtleGame(players_number, turtles_positions, turtles_colors)
```

| Parameter           | Meaning                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `players_number`    | Number of players/turtles |
| `turtles_positions` | List of Y positions       |
| `turtles_colors`    | List of turtle colors     |

### Key Attributes

| Attribute                | Role                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `self.players`           | Dictionary: `{player_name: bet_color}` |
| `self.object_turtles`    | Instance of `MakingRacers`             |
| `self.object_race`       | Instance of `Run`                      |
| `self.object_get_result` | Instance of `GetResult`                |

### Methods

#### `play_game()`

Runs the full game pipeline in correct order.

tip =====> **Order matters. If you change it, the game breaks.**

#### `make_racer()`

* Call the class MakingRacers
* Creates turtles with the given data by main.py
* Give it color
* Give it shap
* And store the turtles inside `self.turtles`

#### `start_game()`

* Call the Run class and start the race
* Move the turtles, giving them random steps (0 - 10)
* Store their total steps via their colors inside `self.turtles_rating`

#### `get_result()`

* Call or make an object using the GetResult class
* It gives the result

tip ====> it print the result by itself

#### `number_of_players()`

* Collects player names
* Collects betting color
* Stores bets in `self.players`

#### `keep_screen()`

Keeps the turtle window open.

## 6. turtle_racer.py — `MakingRacers`

### Purpose

Creates turtle objects and places them on the screen.

### Constructor

```python
MakingRacers(count_of_players, turtle_color, turtle_position)
```

### Internal Behavior

* Creates one turtle per player
* Assigns unique colors
* Assigns **random but non‑overlapping** Y positions

---

## 7. race.py — `Run`

### Purpose

Handles turtle movement and determines when the race ends.

### Constructor Logic

```python
Run(players, turtles)
```

* Race starts **only if at least one player has a bet** it is checked by the function `check_values`
* Movement is random per frame

### Race Rules

* Turtles move forward randomly (0–10)
* If turtle goes beyond +350 → turns around
* If turtle reaches −350 → race stops

### Output

```python
self.turtles_rating = {color: x_position}
```

Used later to determine winners.

---

## 8. bet_result.py — `GetResult`

### Purpose

Evaluates bets and prints results.

### Input

```python
GetResult(turtles_rating, players)
```

### Logic

* Sorts turtles by distance
* Matches top 3 turtles to player bets
* Prints winners or turtle colors

### Sorting Rule

```python
sorted(turtles_rating.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])
```

Lowest X value = first position (counter‑intuitive). it is why, the turtles turn around and when they come back they take negative values.

## 9. How to Reuse This Project

This project is a <<<multi‑player Turtle Racing betting game>>> built with Python’s `turtle` graphics library. Players place bets on turtle colors, turtles race across the screen with random movement, and the game announces winners based on precedence of reaching the final position.

### Change Number of Players

* Update input range in `main.py`
* Ensure color & position lists are long enough

### Change Turtle Speed

In `race.py`:

```python
random.randint(0, 20)
```

### Change Winning Positions

Modify `GetResult` to support more than 3 winners.

### Add Input Validation (Recommended)

Ensure players can only bet on existing colors.

Use this documentation as your contract: follow it, and the game won’t collapse.
